            <h1 style="color: #6d8700">Naturopathy</h1>
            <p>The term "naturopathy" originates from "natura" (Latin root for birth) and "pathos" (the Greek root for suffering) to suggest "natural healing". It is a form of alternative medicine that employs an array of pseudoscientific practices branded as "natural", "non-invasive", or promoting "self-healing". The ideology and methods of naturopathy are based on vitalism and folk medicine. It uses natural therapies such as Nutrition, Herbal Medicine, Acupuncture, Homeopathy, Hydrotherapy, Physical Manipulations, Colonic Irrigation, Fasting, Exercise and others, following Naturopathic principles.</p>
            <h2 style="color: #6d8700">Principles of Naturopathy:</h2>
            <h5 style="color: #6d8700">1. The Healing Power of Nature</h5>
            <p>The body can heal itself, given the right condition and treatment. There is a ‘Vital Force’ which is stimulated to promote health.</p>
            <h5 style="color: #6d8700">2. Treat the Cause, not a symptom</h5>
            <p>Identify the underlying cause of illness rather than eliminating (suppressing) symptoms.</p>
            <h5 style="color: #6d8700">3. Treat the Whole Person</h5>
            <p>Recognise a patient’s individuality by taking into account individual physical, mental, genetic, environmental, social, and other factors.</p>
            <h5 style="color: #6d8700">4. Prevention is preferable to cure</h5>
            <p>Prevention is preferable to cure in order to keep the Vital Force at all times at its optimum.</p>
            <h5 style="color: #6d8700">5. Education</h5>
            <p>The Naturopath educates his patients by bringing a better understanding of health, how to maintain it and how to avoid getting sick. This way the patient can take responsibility for himself.</p>
            <h5 style="color: #6d8700">6. Do no Harm</h5>
            <p>Utilise the most natural, least invasive ans least toxic therapies.</p>
